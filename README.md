# RubyMinesweeper
Just a toy project to teach myself Ruby


It implements a Minesweeper game on console.  
By default it uses a 3x3 grid with 2 mines to help debugging, but it can changed easily.

To run it, just run the game.rb file (ruby game.rb)
Here is a game example:

? ? ?  
? ? ?  
? ? ?  
Please type a row number (0-2)  
1  
Please type a col number (0-2)  
1  

? ? ?  
? 2 ?  
? ? ?  
Please type a row number (0-2)  
0  
Please type a col number (0-2)  
1  
Sorry, you lost, but with some practice you'll get there!
